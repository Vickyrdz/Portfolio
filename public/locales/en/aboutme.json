    "text": "I started my journey in programming at the beginning of 2022 at CoderHouse where I learned JavaScript and React technologies. Then I enrolled in the 'SoyHenry' bootcamp, during those months I reinforced my JavaScript and React knowledge, in addition I learned SQL, Express, Redux and Node. I also had the opportunity to develop my soft skills as a teaching assistant there where I helped other students take their first steps in programming. While I perform better on the front end, my goal is to do both sides. I finished the bootcamp at the beginning of September 2023, I deeply want to keep learning and developing myself.",
